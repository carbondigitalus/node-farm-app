## Quick Notes <a name="quickNotes"></a>

It's an industry standard to utilize Google Chrome as your development browser. During development, it's my personal preference to use Firefox instead of Chrome.

If you want to use the same browser as me for consistency in how things look on my computer and yours, you can download the [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) browser.

All of the recorded videos will be uploaded to YouTube. The only way you can access these videos is by using the URL for the playlist. The title of the video will match the repo title. Today's title is "node lesson 001" so that's the video you look for.
